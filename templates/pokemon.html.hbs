  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This patch is intended for people who want a well defined challenge mode, and don't have time to waste on grinding to play optimally. I recommend following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B5rdsHPC9U">PokemonChallenge's rules</a>, which I'll summarise here.<p>
  <p>The following changes are made to grinding:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set EV yields of all Pokemon to zero, and prevent usage of vitamins, removing the need to EV train. This also removes one advantage you can have over NPC's Pokemon, increasing the challenge.</li>
    <li>Add rare candies to all marts for 1â‚½, removing the need to grind EXP.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following rules <i>are</i> enforced:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nickname every Pokemon. The prompt when receiving a Pokemon is skipped, and you can't exit by entering a blank name.</li>
    <li>Items can't be used in battle, except balls. Healing items and X items are completely overpowered.</li>
    <li>Always use set mode. Switch mode gives a huge tempo advantage over NPCs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following rules <i>are not</i> enforced, and must be followed manually:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only capture the first encounter (or gift etc.) in a location, based on the "Met at" field in the Pokemon summary. Manipulation with repels etc. is allowed. In-game trades are allowed regardless of location. Dupes/species clause apply, but not shiny clause.</li>
    <li>Permadeath &ndash; can't use a Pokemon after it faints, and game over after whiting out.</li>
    <li>Level caps &ndash; can't use a Pokemon with a higher level than the highest level Pokemon of the next boss (e.g. gym leader). For the Pokemon League, use the last elite four member.</li>
  </ul>
